            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
              I am a junior software developer based in the beautiful North West
              of England.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy problem solving, learning unfamiliar tech, design and
              collaborating with others. Additionally I have a great
              appreciation for coffee and cake{" "}

                ‚òïÔ∏èüç∞
              </span>
              . In my spare time I enjoy travel, photography, coding meet-ups
              and hill walking (shown in my interests gallery). Please have a
              look at my tradtional CV / Experience links and contact me with
              any queries or opportunities. I have a concentrated history in
              environmental emissions monitoring / compliance and I am looking
              for a new challenege in software development.
